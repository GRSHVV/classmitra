We shall also discuss about rainbow formation, splitting of white light and blue colour of the sky.",

        "text": "The eye lens is composed of a fibrous, jelly-like material. Its curvature can be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles. When the muscles are relaxed, the lens becomes thin. Thus, its focal length increases. This enables us to see distant objects clearly. To see an object comfortably and distinctly, you must hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes. The farthest point upto which the eye can see objects clearly is called the far point of the eye. It is infinity for a nor mal eye.",

Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray, as they pass through a prism. The red light bends the least while the violet the most. It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a spectrum. A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower (Fig. 10.7). It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets, present in the atmosphere.",

The starlight, on entering the earth’s atmosphere, undergoes refraction continuously before it reaches the earth. Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying, its apparent position fluctuates. The amount of star light entering the eye flickers – the star sometimes appears brighter , and at some othethe.",
